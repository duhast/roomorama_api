Linen needs renewal. Furniture and cupboards need either cleaning or renewal. High potential however :) One thumb up, the other one down.",

The subway was convenient to get to midtown and the 116 crosstown bus also made it easy to get to the west side.  The only draw back is that 116th Street is far enough up town that once I left in the morning I didn't return until I was ready to go to bed .",

I mean we used it just to sleep at night and have a shower! the position is pretty good, very closed to the subway station (6 116th). A little noisy in the night but where is quite in NY?? The wi-fi connection works very good!\r\nMy feedback can't be negative, I invite everyone who needs a low cost apartment for a week, 10 days and who stays outside in Ny all day.",

We could even easily add an extra night when our flight got cancelled due to a snow storm.\r\nThe location is close to a subway station with trains leaving for downtown every couple of minutes. All in all, we had a great time in New York and Aram's place definitely makes a big part of that! Thanks!",

Tha appartment was fine and we had everything we need it and the last day he let us leave our stuff till the time we had to go to the airport. Really good experience. Thanks Aram.",

We enjoyed the space, and everything we needed was there so we could relax. Ahhhhhh! My main recommendations are (1) ear plugs if you sleep on the futon in the front room, 'cos there's considerable street noise (the back room filters out most of it) and (2) strong legs and back 'cos that walk-up staircase is narrow and steep.\r\n\r\nWe like it and were comfortable and would stay here again 'cos it is clean, spacious, and convenient to subways and buses.",

The #6 train is\r\n2 1/2 blocks away, providing easy access to the rest of the city.  We\r\nwalked around the neighborhood at all hours and felt safe.  We would\r\ndefinitely stay there again!

And yes - it has a  100 y\\o fireplace (it is not in use though, but you still have it) windows and  giant mirrors framed in carved wood, decorated wooden floors and well working  window shutter. The nearest Subway is six minutes on feet. ",

Found an Aldi grocery store, Target, Old Navy and a few other stores just past 1 ave and Aram provides a shopping cart to take to the store, very helpful!!!  The walls and doors are somewhat thin and noise can be heard from other apts but generally this was not a problem.  Aram is reachable if/when needed and is extremely kind and helpful. ",
